# Python Logging Utils
Python Logging Utils is a collection of utility functions for logging in Python applications. It provides functions to log multiple messages with different levels of severity in a single function call.

## Installation
You can install Python Logging Utils using pip:


--pip install python-logging-utils
## Usage
To use Python Logging Utils in your Python code, simply import the log_message function and call it with the desired severity level and messages:


from logging_utils import log_message

## Log debug messages
log_message(1, "This is a debug message", "Another debug message")

## Log warning message
log_message(3, "Warning: Something unexpected happened")

## Log error message
log_message(4, "Error: An error occurred while processing data")

## Data Aggregation Utility
This Python utility provides functions for aggregating data from multiple sources. It allows users to input data from the command line prompt, handles invalid input gracefully, aggregates the data from multiple sources, and prints the aggregated data.

## Features
Accepts data from multiple sources provided by the user.
Handles invalid input gracefully, printing an error message and continuing to prompt for input.
Aggregates data from all sources into a single list.
Provides an example usage in the main part of the code.
## Installation
No installation is required. Simply download the data_aggregation.py file and run it using a Python interpreter.

## Data Aggregation and Sorting Utility
This Python script provides functionality for aggregating data from multiple sources and sorting it using various techniques.

## Features
Aggregate data from multiple sources.
Sort the aggregated data using different sorting techniques: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort.
Users can input data sources and specify the sorting technique from the command line prompt.
Error handling for invalid input.
Installation
No installation is required. Simply download the data_aggregation_and_sorting.py file and run it using a Python interpreter.
