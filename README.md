# Python Logging Utils

Python Logging Utils is a collection of utility functions for logging in Python applications. It provides functions to log multiple messages with different levels of severity in a single function call.

## Features
Accepts data from multiple sources provided by the user.
Handles invalid input gracefully, printing an error message and continuing to prompt for input.
Aggregates data from all sources into a single list.
Provides an example usage in the main part of the code.
Installation (Aggregation)
No installation is required. Simply download the data_aggregation.py file and run it using a Python interpreter.

# Data Aggregation and Sorting Utility
This Python script provides functionality for aggregating data from multiple sources and sorting it using various techniques.

## Usage
Features (Aggregation Sorting)
Aggregate data from multiple sources.
Sort the aggregated data using different sorting techniques: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort.
Users can input data sources and specify the sorting technique from the command line prompt.
Error handling for invalid input.
Installation (Aggregation Sorting)
No installation is required. Simply download the data_aggregation_and_sorting.py file and run it using a Python interpreter.

# Command-Line Calculator
Welcome to the Command-Line Calculator! This simple calculator allows you to perform basic mathematical operations from the command line.

## Usage
To use the calculator, follow these steps:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the command_line_interface.py file.
Run the script using the following command format:

python command_line_interface.py OPERATION NUMBERS
Replace OPERATION with the desired mathematical operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and NUMBERS with the numbers you want to perform the operation on. Separate each number with a space.

For example, to add the numbers 5, 3, and 2, you would run:


python command_line_interface.py add 5 3 2
## Supported Operations
The calculator supports the following mathematical operations:

Addition (add)
Subtraction (subtract)
Multiplication (multiply)
Division (divide)
## Example
Here's an example of how to use the calculator:


python command_line_interface.py subtract 10 5 3
This command will subtract 5 and 3 from 10 and display the result.

## Notes
The calculator accepts both integer and floating-point numbers as input.
If an operation requires more than two numbers (e.g., subtraction), provide all the numbers separated by spaces.
If you encounter any issues or errors, please check your input and try again.
Enjoy calculating!


## You can install Python Logging Utils using pip:

```sh
pip install python-logging-utils
Usage
To use Python Logging Utils in your Python code, simply import the log_message function and call it with the desired severity level and messages:


from logging_utils import log_message

# Log debug messages
log_message(1, "This is a debug message", "Another debug message")

# Log warning message
log_message(3, "Warning: Something unexpected happened")

# Log error message
log_message(4, "Error: An error occurred while processing data")
